# FizzBuzz

Fizzbuzz is the time honored example program in which you need to write a program that returns "Fizz" for numbers divided by 3, "Buzz" for numbers divided by 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both. If a number is not divisible by either just return the number. Now go JavaScript!

To run the specs follow these commands:

```shell
- first install the required node modules to run the tests
  `npm install`
- to run in the command line run
  `npm test -- spec/fizzbuzz.spec.js`

### or, via the custom script in package.json

`npm run answer`
```
